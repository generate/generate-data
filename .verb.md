## Heads up!

This plugin modifies the `app.cache.data` object with "expanded" values. For example, the following `author` property from package.json:

```js
{
  author: 'Jon Schlinkert (https://github.com/jonschlinkert)'
}
```

Is expanded to:

```js
{
  author: {
    name: 'Jon Schlinkert',
    url: 'https://github.com/jonschlinkert'
  }
}
```

**"original" data**

Before data is modified, it's cloned and set on the `app.cache.originalData` object. You can reset the data object to this value by doing something like the following:

```js
app.cache.data = app.cache.clonedData;
```

## Usage

Use as a plugin inside your [generate][] generator:

```js
module.exports = function(app) {
  app.use(require('generate-data'));
};
```
